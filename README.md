# healthcare-dataset
This is a repo for my healthcare dataset.
This dataset, created by Albertsun, tracks Covid-19 cases at colleges and universities across the United States. It includes information such as the date of the last update, the state, county, and city where the institution is located, and its IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System) ID number. The dataset reports the total number of COVID-19 cases among students and staff, including medical personnel, from the start of the pandemic. It also provides the number of new cases reported since January 1, 2021, it also includes specific notes about the data when needed. Colleges with no cases are marked with a zero, while those that haven't reported data have empty entries.
